        <H3>The way i see art:</H3>
        <ol>
          <li>I see art is a way to express your soul so theres no wrong way to do it! Every piece is beautiful! Theres people that will tell you its worth nothing, but it could be the world to anyone else. Dont pay attention to haters!</li>
           <li>So many times ive been discouraged y a piece that doesnt work out, but if you stop it will never work out, so dont let others get in your head no matter what, so is why i want others to inspir each others ideas, dont knock anyones down.</li>

        <H2>Anything Can Be Art</H2>
        <p>
         I think depending on the person, everything or nothing is art. For example, rain drops on the windowsill. Its somthing simple, but its natures art. The way the water fall from the skys, like teardrops and splashes and breaks into many circular drops, taps off every surface like music, and thinking of that, poetry is also art.
