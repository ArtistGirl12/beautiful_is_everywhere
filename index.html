        <H2>The way i see art:</H2>
        <
        <ol>
          <li>I see art is a way to express your soul so theres no wrong way to do it! Every piece is beautiful! Theres people that will tell you its worth nothing, but it could be the world to anyone else. Dont pay attention to haters!</li>
           <li>So many times ive been discouraged by a piece that doesnt work out, but if you stop it will never work out, so dont let others get in your head no matter what, so is why i want others to inspir each others ideas, dont knock anyones down.</li>
          <li>Idont think that talent should change who makes art. I think that everyone has the chance, so same ability to try it, it just depends the work you put in.Find a beautiful piece of art. "If you fall in love with Van Gogh or Matisse or John Oliver Killens, or if you fall love with the music of Coltrane, the music of Aretha Franklin, or the music of Chopin - find some beautiful art and admire it, and realize that that was created by human beings just like you, no more human, no less."

        <H2>Anything Can Be Art</H2>
        <p>
         I think depending on the person, everything or nothing is art. For example, rain drops on the windowsill. Its somthing simple, but its natures art. The way the water fall from the skys, like teardrops and splashes and breaks into many circular drops, taps off every surface like music, and thinking of that, poetry is also art.
          "Poetry is what in a poem makes you laugh, cry, prickle, be silent, makes your toe nails twinkle, makes you want to do this or that or nothing, makes you know that you are alone in the unknown world, that your bliss and suffering is forever shared and forever all your own." â€• Dylan Thomas, which is why i love poetry so much,
        and have so much respect for it, and other types of art because of the emotion behind it, for example, painting and drawings are all great ways to do it!

          "There are so many awful things in this world, but I wanted readers to share with me the small, beautiful, enjoyable things. Things like cute clothes, beautiful art and pretty flowers; items that are overflowing with beauty. If you just become obsessed with your own problems, you miss these things. When you discover them, you become happy."- Novala Takemoto
